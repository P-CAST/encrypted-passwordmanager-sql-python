This is a passwordmanager program with password encryption and security 
interface is easy to understand and has a clear instruction in every progress throughout the program .

To start you need to install xampp and start apache and mysql service,then create a database(name: db_password) also table(name: tb_nap) and you're ready to go.

If you want to insert new row use i/I command.
If you want to view your exist data use v/V command.

Thankyou for using my program.
Enjoy!
